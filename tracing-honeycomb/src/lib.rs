//! This crate provides:
//! - A tracing layer, `TelemetryLayer`, that can be used to publish trace data to [honeycomb.io][].
//! - Utilities for implementing distributed tracing against the honeycomb.io backend.
//!
//! As a tracing layer, `TelemetryLayer` can be composed with other layers to provide stdout logging, filtering, etc.
//!
//! ### Propagating distributed tracing metadata
//!
//! This crate provides two functions for out of band interaction with the `TelemetryLayer`
//! - `register_dist_tracing_root` registers the current span as the local root of a distributed trace.
//! - `current_dist_trace_ctx` fetches the `TraceId` and `SpanId` associated with the current span.
//!
//! Here's an example of how they might be used together:
//! 1. Some span is registered as the global tracing root using a newly-generated `TraceId`.
//! 2. A child of that span uses `current_dist_trace_ctx` to fetch the current `TraceId` and `SpanId`. It passes these values along with an RPC request, as metadata.
//! 3. The RPC service handler uses the `TraceId` and remote parent `SpanId` provided in the request's metadata to register the handler function's span as a local root of the distributed trace initiated in step 1.
//!
//! ### Registering a global Subscriber
//!
//! The following example shows how to create and register a subscriber created by composing `TelemetryLayer` with other layers and the `Registry` subscriber provided by the `tracing_subscriber` crate.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use tracing_honeycomb::new_honeycomb_telemetry_layer;
//! use tracing_subscriber::prelude::*;
//! use tracing_subscriber::{filter::LevelFilter, fmt, registry::Registry};
//!
//! let honeycomb_config = libhoney::Config {
//!     options: libhoney::client::Options {
//!         api_key: std::env::var("HONEYCOMB_WRITEKEY").unwrap(),
//!         dataset: "my-dataset-name".to_string(),
//!         ..libhoney::client::Options::default()
//!     },
//!     transmission_options: libhoney::transmission::Options::default(),
//! };
//!
//! let telemetry_layer = new_honeycomb_telemetry_layer("my-service-name", honeycomb_config);
//!
//! // NOTE: the underlying subscriber MUST be the Registry subscriber
//! let subscriber = Registry::default() // provide underlying span data store
//!     .with(LevelFilter::INFO) // filter out low-level debug tracing (eg tokio executor)
//!     .with(fmt::Layer::default()) // log to stdout
//!     .with(telemetry_layer); // publish to honeycomb backend
//!
//! tracing::subscriber::set_global_default(subscriber).expect("setting global default failed");
//! ```
//!
//! ### Testing
//!
//! Since `TraceCtx::current_trace_ctx` and `TraceCtx::record_on_current_span` can be expected to return `Ok` as long as some `TelemetryLayer` has been registered as part of the layer/subscriber stack and the current span is active, it's valid to `.expect` them to always succeed & to panic if they do not. As a result, you may find yourself writing code that fails if no distributed tracing context is present. This means that unit and integration tests covering such code must provide a `TelemetryLayer`. However, you probably don't want to publish telemetry while running unit or integration tests. You can fix this problem by registering a `TelemetryLayer` constructed using `BlackholeTelemetry`. `BlackholeTelemetry` discards spans and events without publishing them to any backend.
//!
//! ```
//! use tracing_honeycomb::new_blackhole_telemetry_layer;
//! use tracing_subscriber::prelude::*;
//! use tracing_subscriber::{filter::LevelFilter, fmt, registry::Registry};
//!
//! let telemetry_layer = new_blackhole_telemetry_layer();
//!
//! // NOTE: the underlying subscriber MUST be the Registry subscriber
//! let subscriber = Registry::default() // provide underlying span data store
//!     .with(LevelFilter::INFO) // filter out low-level debug tracing (eg tokio executor)
//!     .with(fmt::Layer::default()) // log to stdout
//!     .with(telemetry_layer); // publish to blackhole backend
//!
//! tracing::subscriber::set_global_default(subscriber).ok();
//! ```
